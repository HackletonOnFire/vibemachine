# Tasks: Reports Functionality Implementation

## Relevant Files

- `src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx` - Main reports page with full functionality, template selection, and report management.
- `src/app/dashboard/reports/page.test.tsx` - Unit tests for reports page component.
- `src/lib/utils/reportGenerator.ts` - Professional PDF report generation with EcoMind branding and comprehensive layouts.
- `src/lib/utils/reportGenerator.test.ts` - Unit tests for report generation functionality.
- `src/hooks/useReports.ts` - Custom hook for report management, generation, and local storage.
- `src/hooks/useReports.test.ts` - Unit tests for reports hook.
- `src/components/reports/ReportGenerationModal.tsx` - Modal component for template selection and report customization.
- `src/components/reports/ReportGenerationModal.test.tsx` - Unit tests for report generation modal.
- `src/__tests__/reports-integration.test.tsx` - Integration tests for complete report generation workflows.
- `src/__tests__/error-handling.test.ts` - Comprehensive error handling and edge case tests.
- `src/__tests__/pdf-quality-validation.test.ts` - PDF output quality and professional formatting validation tests.
- `src/components/reports/index.ts` - Barrel exports for reports components.
- `package.json` - Updated with PDF generation dependencies (jspdf, html2canvas, @react-pdf/renderer).

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `ReportGenerator.tsx` and `ReportGenerator.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- PDF generation uses jsPDF for structured reports with professional layouts and branding.
- Reports include executive summaries, business profiles, energy analysis, carbon footprint tracking, and AI recommendations.
