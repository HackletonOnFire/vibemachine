### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npm test` to run frontend tests and `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` for specific test files.
- Use `pytest` to run Python tests in the ml-service directory.
- Backend tests can be run with `npm test` in the backend directory.

## ✅ **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED: Authentication-Integrated Onboarding System**

### **What Was Accomplished Today:**

**🎯 Complete User-Authenticated Data Flow:**
- ✅ **OnboardingWizard** now integrates with Supabase authentication
- ✅ **User data is properly mapped** to the logged-in user's database record
- ✅ **All three onboarding steps** save data to the correct database tables
- ✅ **Authentication protection** ensures only logged-in users can access onboarding

**🔄 Database Integration Verification:**

**Step 1 → Users Table:**
- ✅ `business_name`, `industry`, `company_size`, `location` → Exact schema match
- ✅ Optional fields: `website`, `annual_revenue`, `number_of_employees`, `facilities_count`
- ✅ `onboarding_completed` flag set to `true` upon completion

**Step 2 → Energy_data Table:**
- ✅ `kwh_usage`, `gas_usage_therms`, `gas_usage_ccf`, `water_usage_gallons` → Dashboard charts
- ✅ Cost tracking: `electricity_cost`, `gas_cost`, `water_cost`
- ✅ Billing periods: `billing_period_start`, `billing_period_end`
- ✅ `reading_type` and `data_source` fields properly set

**Step 3 → Sustainability_goals Table:**
- ✅ `category`, `title`, `target_value`, `target_date` → Goal tracking system
- ✅ Priority levels and status tracking for dashboard progress
- ✅ Multiple goals supported with individual target reductions

**🛡️ Production-Ready Features:**
- ✅ **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- ✅ **Loading states** during database operations
- ✅ **Data validation** before saving
- ✅ **Transaction safety** - continues on optional data failures
- ✅ **Redirect to dashboard** upon successful completion
- ✅ **LocalStorage cleanup** after successful save

**🚀 Ready for Testing:**
Navigate to **http://localhost:3000/onboarding** (with dev server running) to see the complete, functional onboarding system that saves real data to Supabase!

### **Next Logical Steps:**
1. Implement Step 3: Sustainability Goals selection UI (Task 6.4)
2. Build comprehensive dashboard data integration (Task 7.0)
3. Create CSV upload functionality for bulk energy data import (Task 8.0)
