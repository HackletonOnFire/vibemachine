### **2025-07-31**

**14:00 - 15:00 UTC | Project Initialization & Verification (Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)**

- **Summary:** Set up the initial project structure for all three services: frontend, backend, and ML.
- **Actions:**
  - Initialized a Next.js 14+ frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
  - Set up a Node.js backend using the Express framework and TypeScript.
  - Initialized a Python ML service using FastAPI with a dedicated virtual environment.
  - Verified that all three services install dependencies and start correctly using `npm run dev` and `python main.py`.
  - **Outcome:** All services confirmed running on their respective ports (3000, 5000, 8000) with basic health checks passing.

**15:00 - 16:00 UTC | Environment & Supabase Config (Task 1.4 & Verification)**

- **Summary:** Configured environment variables across all services and successfully verified the connection to the user's Supabase project.
- **Actions:**
  - Updated `next.config.js`, `backend/src/server.ts`, and `ml-service/main.py` to securely load and validate environment variables.
  - Enhanced service health checks to report the status of their environment configuration.
  - Created `docs/environment-setup.md` with detailed instructions for other developers.
- **Supabase Connection Verification:**
  - Created a test script (`scripts/test-supabase.js`) to provide a definitive connection test.
  - Added `dotenv` and `@supabase/supabase-js` as dependencies.
  - Collaboratively debugged and resolved issues with `.env.local` file naming (`env.local` -> `.env.local`) and script pathing.
  - **Outcome:** Confirmed a successful connection to the user's Supabase project. The API keys are correct and the authentication service is accessible.

**16:00 - 16:15 UTC | Monorepo Scripting (Task 1.5)**

- **Summary:** Implemented a unified scripting approach to manage all services from the root directory, simplifying the development workflow.
- **Actions:**
  - Created a root `package.json` to act as the monorepo orchestrator.
  - Added `concurrently` and `npm-run-all` to run multiple scripts in parallel.
  - **New Root Scripts:**
    - `npm install`: Now automatically installs dependencies for all services (`install-all`).
    - `npm run dev`: Starts frontend, backend, and ML services simultaneously.
    - `npm run build-all`: Builds frontend and backend projects in parallel.
    - `npm run test-all`: Runs test suites for all services.
  - Refined `package.json` scripts in both the frontend and backend services to include `lint:fix`, `test:watch`, and `format` commands.
- **Outcome:** The project can now be managed with simple, intuitive commands from the root folder, significantly improving developer experience.

**16:15 - 16:30 UTC | Unified Linting & Formatting (Task 1.6)**

- **Summary:** Centralized the ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configurations to enforce a single, consistent code style across the entire monorepo.
- **Actions:**
  - **Prettier:** Created a root `.prettierrc.json` and `.prettierignore` to establish a single source of truth for code formatting.
  - **ESLint:**
    - Created a root `.eslintrc.json` with base rules for TypeScript and Prettier integration.
    - Refactored the frontend and backend ESLint configurations to extend the root config, reducing duplication.
  - **TypeScript:**
    - Created a root `tsconfig.base.json` to hold common compiler options.
    - Refactored the frontend and backend `tsconfig.json` files to extend the base config.
- **Outcome:** All services now share a common set of rules for code quality and style, which will prevent inconsistencies and make the codebase easier to maintain.
