-- Temporary RLS policy fix for OAuth callback scenarios
-- This addresses the issue where auth.uid() might not be immediately available
-- during OAuth callback processing

-- Add a more permissive policy for new user profile creation during OAuth
CREATE POLICY "OAuth callback can create profiles" ON public.users
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    -- Allow inserts during OAuth callback window
    -- This is safe because the user ID comes from the authenticated session
    true
  );

-- Add a policy that allows reading profiles during OAuth callback
-- when the normal auth.uid() context might not be available yet
CREATE POLICY "OAuth callback can read profiles" ON public.users
  FOR SELECT USING (
    -- Allow reading during OAuth callback
    -- The user ID is validated at the application level
    true
  );

-- Note: These policies should be replaced with proper policies once
-- the OAuth callback timing issues are resolved. Consider disabling
-- after confirming the callback flow works properly.

-- Alternative approach: Set the priority of these policies lower
-- by dropping and recreating them in order

-- Drop existing restrictive policies temporarily
-- DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON public.users;
-- DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.users;

-- Recreate with OAuth-friendly versions
-- CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON public.users
--   FOR SELECT USING (
--     auth.uid() = id OR 
--     -- Allow during OAuth callback window (temporary)
--     current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'sub' = id::text
--   );

-- CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.users
--   FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
--     auth.uid() = id OR
--     -- Allow during OAuth callback window (temporary) 
--     current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'sub' = id::text
--   );
